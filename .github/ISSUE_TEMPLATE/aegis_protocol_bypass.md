## Attack Technique

Name/description of the bypass technique.

## Which Layer is Bypassed?

- [ ] Input Scanner
- [ ] Stream Monitor
- [ ] Action Validator
- [ ] Sandbox
- [ ] Quarantine type system

## Reproduction

```typescript
// Minimal test case that demonstrates the bypass
```

## Why It Works

Explain the mechanism — why does this evade detection?

## Suggested Fix

(Optional) How the detection could be improved.

## Severity Assessment

- [ ] Critical — complete bypass of a core defense layer
- [ ] High — bypasses detection for a significant attack category
- [ ] Medium — bypasses detection under specific conditions
- [ ] Low — theoretical bypass or edge case
