# Hall of Fame

This page recognizes contributors who have submitted verified prompt injection bypasses through **The Aegis Protocol** — our community red teaming program.

If you discover a bypass that evades Aegis's defenses, submit it as a failing test case. If we confirm it's a genuine bypass and add it to our test suite, you earn a spot here.

## How to Submit

1. Fork this repo
2. Add a failing test in `tests/adversarial/bypasses/`
3. Include a clear description of the attack technique
4. Submit a PR with the title `[Protocol] <description>`

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for full details.
